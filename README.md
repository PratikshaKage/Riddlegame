# Riddlegame
This is  riddle game where I used binary trees and postorder traversal to traverse through the tree where each node had a riddle. 
Only after answering that riddle will it move to the other node. The player is given three chances to answer the puzzle,
if the answer is wrong the first time, and if these chances are exhausted, the player will have to start the game again.
